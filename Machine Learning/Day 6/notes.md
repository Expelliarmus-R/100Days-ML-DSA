# Day 6 â€“ Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Revised the **basics of Linear Regression**  
- Understood how the model fits a line by minimizing the error between predicted and actual values  
- Explored the intuition behind coefficients and intercept in regression  

---

### Steps Covered  
1. Revisited the **Linear Regression concept** in depth  
2. Learned about the idea of **best fit line** and how it minimizes error  
3. Connected regression to real-world applications like predicting housing prices  

---

###  Reflection  
- Linear Regression is simple but forms the **foundation of supervised learning**  
- Building intuition about coefficients helped me see how features influence predictions  
- Understanding these basics is essential before moving into advanced ML algorithms
