# Day 16 – Artificial Intelligence / LangChain  

###  Progress  
- Designed the basic **flow of the itinerary planner**  
- Integrated user inputs like destination & number of days  
- Set up initial structure for fetching weather and places info  

---

###  Reflection  
- LangChain makes it easier to connect **LLMs with tools and APIs**  
- Excited to see how this project evolves into a **full-stack AI app**  
- Tomorrow, I’ll refine the logic and improve the **user interaction flow**
