Steps in a Supervised Learning Workflow (Correct Order)

Find Data Source

Identify the dataset source (CSV, API, database, Kaggle, etc.)

Load the Data

Import the dataset into your environment (e.g., pandas.read_csv())

Clean the Data

Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, inconsistent formats

Apply feature scaling/encoding if needed

Split the Data

Divide into training set (to learn) and testing set (to evaluate)

Common split: 80% training / 20% testing

Train the Model

Feed training data to a chosen ML algorithm

Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

Test the Model

Evaluate performance on testing data (unseen samples)

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, RMSE, etc
