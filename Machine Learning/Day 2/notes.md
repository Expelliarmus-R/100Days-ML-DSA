## What I Learned Today

Understood the workflow of supervised learning

Learned the correct sequence of steps to follow in an ML project

Realized the importance of data preprocessing (cleaning & splitting) before training

Understood how training and testing phases ensure the model generalizes well

## Steps in Supervised Learning (in correct order)

Find Data Source – identify dataset (CSV, API, database, Kaggle, etc.)

Load the Data – import into environment (e.g., Pandas)

Clean the Data – handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, scaling, encoding

Split the Data – training vs testing set (e.g., 80:20)

Train the Model – apply chosen ML algorithm on training set

Test the Model – evaluate on unseen/testing set with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, RMSE, etc.)
