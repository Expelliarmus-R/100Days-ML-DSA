# Day 2 – Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Understood the **workflow of supervised learning**  
- Learned the **correct sequence of steps** to follow in an ML project  
- Realized the importance of **data preprocessing** (cleaning & splitting) before training  
- Understood how training and testing phases ensure the model generalizes well

###  Steps in Supervised Learning (in correct order)  

1. **Find Data Source** – identify dataset (CSV, API, database, Kaggle, etc.)  
2. **Load the Data** – import into environment (e.g., Pandas)  
3. **Clean the Data** – handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, scaling, encoding  
4. **Split the Data** – training vs testing set (e.g., 80:20)  
5. **Train the Model** – apply chosen ML algorithm on training set  
6. **Test the Model** – evaluate on unseen/testing set with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, RMSE, etc.)

### 📝 Reflection  
- Training without cleaning/splitting leads to wrong conclusions  
- This pipeline forms the **foundation of any ML project**  
- Tomorrow, I’ll go deeper into **supervised learning types (regression vs classification)**
