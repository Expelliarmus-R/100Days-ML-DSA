# Day 5 â€“ Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Learned the **basics of Linear Regression**  
- Understood how a regression model tries to fit a straight line between features and target  
- Practiced the **end-to-end ML pipeline**: loading data, splitting, training, and testing  

---

### Steps Covered  
1. Explored the **California Housing dataset** from sklearn  
2. Split the dataset into **training and testing sets** using `train_test_split`  
3. Trained a **Linear Regression model** using `LinearRegression()`  
4. Made predictions on the test set  
5. Visualized the results with a **scatter plot** to compare predictions vs. actual values  

---

###  Reflection  
- Understood how **Linear Regression** forms the foundation of many ML algorithms  
- Learned why splitting data is important to check **generalization and avoid overfitting**  
- Visualizing predictions vs. actual values gave better intuition about **model accuracy**
