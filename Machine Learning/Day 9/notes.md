# Day 9 â€“ Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Implemented **Linear Regression from scratch**  
- Understood the math behind the algorithm:
- Hypothesis function: h(x) = m*x + c  
- Cost function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Gradient Descent for optimization  

---

###  Key Steps  
1. Initialized parameters (weights & bias)  
2. Defined hypothesis function  
3. Calculated cost (MSE)  
4. Updated parameters using Gradient Descent  
5. Iterated until convergence

###  Reflection  
- Writing Linear Regression without libraries gave me a strong intuition of how optimization works.  
- Now I see clearly how **training is just minimizing cost by adjusting weights**.  
- Next: Explore regularization and multivariate regression.
