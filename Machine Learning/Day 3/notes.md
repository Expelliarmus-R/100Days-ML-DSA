# Day 3 – Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Loaded my first dataset using **scikit-learn** (`fetch_california_housing`)  
- Understood how `sklearn.datasets` provide **preloaded sample datasets** for practice  
- These datasets are already **cleaned & structured**, so no preprocessing is needed initially  

###  Reflection  
- Learned how to quickly get **ready-to-use datasets** in sklearn  
- This is useful for focusing on learning ML algorithms instead of worrying about data cleaning at the start  
- Tomorrow, I’ll explore **Regression basics** using this dataset
