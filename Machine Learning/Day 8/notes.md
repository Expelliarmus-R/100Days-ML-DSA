# Day 8 – Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Moved beyond **Linear Regression basics** and explored its practical implementation  
- Learned how to **split data into training and testing sets**  
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** using sklearn  
- Evaluated predictions and visualized the relationship between actual vs predicted values  

---

### Topics Covered  
1. **Data Splitting** – using `train_test_split`  
2. **Model Training** – fitting `LinearRegression` on training data  
3. **Prediction** – generating predictions on test data  
4. **Visualization** – scatter plot of actual vs predicted values

###  Reflection  
- Practicing Linear Regression beyond basics helped me understand how models are applied on real datasets  
- Visualization made it clearer how well the model predicts  
- This step gave me confidence to move towards more advanced ML algorithms
