# Day 1 - Machine Learning Basics ðŸ¤–

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
1. **What is Machine Learning?**
   - Field of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

2. **Types of Machine Learning**
   - **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Works on unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Agent learns by interacting with environment (reward/punishment based).

3. **AI vs ML**
   - **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Broad field of creating smart systems.
   - **ML (Machine Learning):** Subset of AI that uses data-driven algorithms to learn patterns.

## âœ… Summary
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI.  
- Three main categories: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement.  
- ML focuses on data-driven learning instead of rule-based programming.
