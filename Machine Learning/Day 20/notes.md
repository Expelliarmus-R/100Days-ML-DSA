# Day 20 â€“ AI / Machine Learning  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Completed a **mini version** of my LangChain + Streamlit AI project  
- Focused on making it functional end-to-end  
- Planned improvements for **future deployment**  

---

###  Reflection  
- Building a working version boosted my confidence in **project execution**  
- Deployment will be the next big step to make it **accessible and usable**  
- Learned that starting small and then iterating is the best approach
