# Day 1 - DSA 

## Topics Learned
- Find the Missing and Repeating Number (Hard Problem)
- Merge Sort (important as a prerequisite)
- Count Inversions (Hard problem, solved using merge sort)


##  Key Takeaways
- Missing & Repeating problem can be solved with hashing, XOR (But i Used common sense and maths) which is the optimal oneðŸ˜‰ .
- Merge Sort helps in solving array-based problems efficiently with O(n log n) ,The best in sorting algorithms.
- Count Inversions is a direct application of merge sort (counting while merging) just only 1 step required more after the merge sort.
