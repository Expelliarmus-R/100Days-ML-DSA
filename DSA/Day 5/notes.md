# Day 5 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Explored problems involving **mathematical search techniques** using **Binary Search on answers**  
- Understood how to apply binary search in **non-traditional search problems** like roots and optimization  
- Practiced reasoning about **constraints and ranges** instead of just arrays  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Nth Root of a Number** – used binary search to find the nth root of an integer  
2. **Square Root of a Number in log(n)** – efficient square root calculation with binary search  
3. **Koko Eating Bananas** – classic binary search on answers to find the minimum eating speed  

---

###  Reflection  
- Realized binary search is not limited to arrays but can solve **mathematical and optimization problems**  
- Learned how to think in terms of **feasibility functions** (can Koko finish at this speed?)  
- These problems built stronger intuition for **applying binary search in new domains**
