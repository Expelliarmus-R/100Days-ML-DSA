# Day 20 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Continued with **String problems** using different approaches  
- Practiced problems involving **conversion, distinct substrings, and beauty calculation**  
- Strengthened understanding of **hashing and frequency maps** in string manipulation  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **ATOI (String to Integer Conversion)** – Implemented manual parsing of strings to integers  
2. **Count Substrings with K Distinct Characters** – Used sliding window & hashing to solve efficiently  
3. **Sum of Beauty of All Substrings** – Calculated beauty of substrings using character frequencies  

---

###  Reflection  
- Learned how **frequency-based logic** simplifies substring-related problems  
- ATOI helped in practicing **edge-case handling** (whitespaces, signs, invalid inputs)  
- Realized the importance of **efficient substring enumeration** for large inputs
