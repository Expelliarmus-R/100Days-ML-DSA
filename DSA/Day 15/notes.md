# Day 15 â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Started with **String basics**  
- Solved initial **string manipulation problems**  
- Focused on building intuition for pattern-based string problems  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. Basic String Problem (introductory level)  

---

###  Reflection  
- Transitioning from **Binary Search** to **Strings**  
- Today was about warming up with basics  
- Tomorrow I plan to solve at least **15 more string problems** to strengthen fundamentals
