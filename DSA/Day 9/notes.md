# Day 9 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Solved two hard / extreme problems that use **binary search on answer space** with greedy checks  
- Practiced turning feasibility checks into O(log range * check) solutions  
- Worked on optimal strategies for allocation and placement under constraints  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Aggressive Cows** – place cows in stalls maximizing minimum distance (binary search + greedy placement).  
2. **Book Allocation** – allocate books to minimize maximum pages per student (binary search on answer + feasibility check).  

---

###  Reflection  
- Both problems reinforce the pattern: convert the problem into a decision (feasible / not feasible) and binary-search over the answer range.  
- Designing a correct and efficient feasibility function is the key — once that’s right, the rest is straightforward.  
- These problems sharpen reasoning about constraints, greedy checks, and edge cases (small ranges, equal values).
