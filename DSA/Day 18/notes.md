# Day 18 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Started solving **basic string pattern problems**  
- Understood how to check **string rotations**  
- Learned about **isomorphic strings** and how mappings work  
- Practiced finding the **longest common prefix** among strings  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Check Whether Another String is a Rotation of Other** – Verified string rotations using concatenation logic  
2. **Isomorphic Strings** – Checked character mapping between two strings  
3. **Longest Common Prefix** – Found prefix shared among a group of strings  

---

###  Reflection  
- String problems improve logical thinking and pattern observation  
- Isomorphic strings taught me the importance of **mapping and hashmaps**  
- Rotation check was a neat trick using **concatenation**  
- Prefix problem gave insights into **incremental checking** in strings
