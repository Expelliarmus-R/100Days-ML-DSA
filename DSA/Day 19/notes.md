# Day 19 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Continued solving **string-based problems**  
- Practiced converting representations and handling **nested structures**  
- Explored frequency-based sorting logic for strings  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Maximum Nesting Depth** – Calculated the maximum depth of nested parentheses  
2. **Roman to Integer** – Converted Roman numerals into integers using value mapping rules  
3. **Sort Characters by Frequency** – Sorted characters in a string based on frequency (descending order)  

---

###  Reflection  
- Parentheses problems sharpen logical thinking around **stack depth**  
- Roman numeral conversion helped reinforce **mapping and edge cases**  
- Sorting by frequency showed the usefulness of **hashmaps + sorting** in string manipulation
