# Day 11 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced **Matrix + Binary Search problems**  
- Strengthened understanding of **k-th element selection in sorted arrays**  
- Improved problem-solving in **matrix traversal and counting ones efficiently**  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **K-th Element in Two Sorted Arrays** – Used binary search partitioning (similar to Median of Two Sorted Arrays) to directly find the k-th element.  
2. **Find the Maximum 1’s in a Binary Matrix** – Optimized approach using row-wise traversal and binary search.  

---

###  Reflection  
- Noticed how **median/k-th element problems share the same partitioning logic**.  
- Learned efficient ways to deal with **matrix problems** instead of brute force.  
- Binary search continues to appear in many **non-traditional forms**!
