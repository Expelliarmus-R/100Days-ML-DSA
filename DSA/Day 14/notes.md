# Day 14 â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced **Median of a Matrix** using Binary Search  
- Completed the **Binary Search playlist** ðŸš€  
- Moved on to **Strings** and solved initial problems  
- Started with basics like **Remove Outer Parentheses** and other string-related sums  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Median of a Matrix** â€“ Applied binary search on the value range  
2. **Remove Outer Parentheses** â€“ Practiced string manipulation fundamentals  
3. A few **basic string problems** to build strong foundations  

---

###  Reflection  
- Closing the Binary Search playlist gave me confidence in applying the technique to various patterns  
- Strings open up a new challenge, requiring more focus on **manipulation and conditions**  
- Excited to continue the journey and explore deeper string problems!
