# Day 8 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced another variation of **Binary Search**  
- Learned how to solve the **Kth Missing Positive Number** problem efficiently  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Kth Missing Positive Number** – used Binary Search to find the missing number instead of linear/brute force methods
