# Day 12 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Strengthened concepts on **matrix-based problems**  
- Applied **binary search patterns** and **row/column traversal logic**  
- Practiced identifying efficient search techniques in 2D arrays  

---

### Problems Covered  
1. **Find the Row with Maximum Number of 1's** – Optimized row scanning using sorted properties  
2. **Search in Row and Column Wise Sorted Matrix** – Used elimination method (start from top-right or bottom-left) for `O(n+m)` search  

---

###  Reflection  
- Learned how to reduce complexity in **matrix search problems**  
- Realized the importance of choosing the **right starting point** in 2D matrices  
- These problems showed how **binary search intuition** extends beyond 1D arrays
