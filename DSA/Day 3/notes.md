# Day 3 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Extended Binary Search to solve real-world style problems  
- Learned how to apply binary search logic in **rotated arrays**  
- Strengthened concepts of searching in sorted/modified arrays  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **First & Last Occurrence** – position of first and last index of element
2. **Count Occurrences** – number of times an element appears  
3. **Search in Rotated Array (without duplicates)** – search efficiently in rotated array    
4. **Search in Rotated Array (with duplicates)** – handle duplicates while searching  
5. **Minimum in Rotated Array** – find min element in rotated sorted array

---

###  Reflection  
- Rotated arrays combine sorted-array logic with binary search → tricky but powerful  
- Handling duplicates needs careful boundary checks
