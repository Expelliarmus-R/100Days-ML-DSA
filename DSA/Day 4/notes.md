# Day 4 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Continued practicing **Binary Search applications**  
- Solved problems around **unique elements** and **rotations in arrays**  
- Understood how Binary Search can reduce complexity in tricky problems  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Peak Element** – find a peak element using binary search  
2. **Single Element in a Sorted Array** – element that appears only once in a sorted array where every other appears twice  
3. **How Many Times an Array Has Been Rotated** – find the number of rotations in a rotated sorted array  

---

###  Reflection  
- Binary Search logic can be adapted to **patterns beyond searching a key**  
- Peak element problem taught me how to think in terms of **local conditions**  
- Rotation count showed connection between **minimum element index** and number of rotations
