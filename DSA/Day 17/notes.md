# Day 17 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced **string manipulation problems**  
- Improved handling of **parsing, reversing, and extracting substrings**  

---

### Problems Covered  
1. **Remove Outermost Parentheses** – removed redundant parentheses from a valid parentheses string  
2. **Reverse Words in a String** – reversed order of words while trimming spaces  
3. **Largest Odd Number in String** – extracted the largest odd number from a numeric string  

---

###  Reflection  
- String problems require strong **index manipulation** and **edge-case handling**  
- Reversing words taught me how to deal with **extra spaces** efficiently  
- The odd number problem showed how **string parsing** connects with numeric logic
