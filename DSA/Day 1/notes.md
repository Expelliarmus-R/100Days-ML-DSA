# Day 1 - DSA 

##  Topics Learned
- Merge Sort (important as a prerequisite)
- Count Inversions (Hard problem, solved using merge sort)
- Find the Missing and Repeating Number(Hard Problem)

##  Key Takeaways
- Merge Sort helps in solving array-based problems efficiently with O(n log n).
- Count Inversions is a direct application of merge sort (counting while merging), The best in sorting algorithms.
- Missing & Repeating problem can be solved with hashing, XOR, But I have used some common sense and MathsðŸ˜‰.
