# Day 23 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Continued working with **Linked Lists**  
- Implemented and practiced key operations like reversing the list, finding the middle node, and deleting the k-th node  

---

###  Topics Covered  
1. **Reverse a Linked List** – Learned both iterative and recursive methods  
2. **Find the Middle Node** – Used the slow and fast pointer (tortoise-hare) technique  
3. **Delete the K-th Node** – Traversed to the (k−1)th node and adjusted links efficiently
