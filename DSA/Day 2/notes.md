# Day 2 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced **Binary Search** and its applications  
- Learned how to use variations like **Lower Bound** and **Upper Bound**  
- Solved problems that extend Binary Search concepts  

---

### Problems Covered  
1.**Reverse Pairs** – advanced problem (uses modified merge sort)    
2. **Floor and Ceil** – finding floor & ceil of an element  
3. **Lower Bound** – first index where element ≥ target  
4. **Upper Bound** – first index where element > target  
5. **Search Insert Position** – position to insert an element in sorted array  
6. **Binary Search** – basic implementation

---

###  Reflection  
- Binary Search is the base for many advanced problems  
- Lower Bound & Upper Bound are handy tools in searching-based problems  (Mainly the lower bound is Important for most of the problems in binary search)
- Reverse Pairs Using the merge sort
