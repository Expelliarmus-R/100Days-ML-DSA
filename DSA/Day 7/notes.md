# Day 7 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Solved **Capacity to Ship Packages within D Days** using binary search on answers  
- Revised some previously solved binary search problems to strengthen concepts  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Capacity to Ship Packages within D Days** – optimize shipping capacity using binary search  
2. Revision of earlier problems:  (As they were kinda complex)
   - Peak Element  
   - Single Element in a Sorted Array  
   - Kth Missing Positive Number  

---

###  Reflection  
- Practicing older problems helped reinforce **binary search patterns**  
- The shipping problem showed how binary search can be applied to **real-world optimization**
