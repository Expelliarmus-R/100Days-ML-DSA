# Day 22 â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms  

### ðŸ“Œ What I Learned Today  
- Started implementing **Linked List** from scratch  
- Learned about **Nodes**, **Pointers**, and how data is connected using references  
- Implemented **Insertion** and **Deletion** operations for linked lists  

---

###  Topics Covered  
1. **Node Class** â€“ Defined a node structure with `data` and `next` pointer  
2. **LinkedList Class** â€“ Created an empty linked list and implemented basic operations  
3. **Insertion Operations** â€“ Insert at start, end, and after a specific target  
4. **Deletion Operations** â€“ Delete first node, delete last node, and delete by value  
5. **Display Function** â€“ Traversed and printed the entire linked list
