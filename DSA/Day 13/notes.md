# Day 13 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced **matrix-related problems** using Binary Search concepts  
- Understood how searching in 2D structures differs from 1D arrays  
- Strengthened skills in **pattern recognition for Binary Search in matrices**  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Peak Element in a Matrix** – find a peak element using divide-and-conquer approach  
2. **Median in a Row-wise Sorted Matrix** – applied binary search on value range to find the median  

---

###  Reflection  
- Learned that Binary Search can be extended beyond arrays into **2D matrix problems**  
- Peak element problem improved my understanding of **local maxima in grids**  
- Median in matrix helped me think in terms of **value space instead of indices**
