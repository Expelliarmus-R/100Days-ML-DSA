# Day 10 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced **advanced Binary Search problems**  
- Focused on **partition-based logic** and **Binary Search on Answer**  
- Improved problem-solving mindset by breaking down hard problems step by step  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays** – Used binary search partitioning to find the median in `O(log(min(n,m)))`  
2. **Painter’s Partition Problem** – Divided work among painters while minimizing maximum workload  
3. **Split Array Largest Sum** – Partitioned array into `k` subarrays to minimize the maximum subarray sum  

---

###  Reflection  
- These problems strengthened my understanding of **Binary Search on the Answer space**  
- Learned that sometimes **binary search is not about elements, but about the answer range**  
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays showed how **clever partitioning** can achieve efficiency  
- Partition problems taught me patience and **step-by-step greedy feasibility checks**
