# Day 33 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Focused on **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** operations and implementations  

---

### Topics Covered  
1. **Insertion in DLL** – At beginning, end, and specific positions  
2. **Deletion in DLL** – By position and by value  
3. **Traversal** – Forward and backward traversals for verification  
4. **Edge Case Handling** – Empty list, single-node list, and invalid positions  

---

### Key Takeaways  
- Learned how to efficiently manage both `prev` and `next` pointers  
- Understood the difference between **Singly Linked List (SLL)** and **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** in terms of flexibility and memory usage  
- Strengthened debugging and visualization skills for pointer-based structures  

---

### Reflection  
Implementing DLL operations helped solidify my grasp of linked list data structures. Managing dual pointers improved my understanding of bidirectional data flow and memory linkage.
