# Day 6 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

###  What I Learned Today  
- Practiced more **Binary Search on answers** style problems  
- Learned how to apply binary search in optimization and constraint-based problems  
- Improved reasoning about feasibility functions and conditions  

---

###  Problems Covered  
1. **Find the Smallest Divisor** – used binary search to minimize the divisor under given constraints  
2. **Kth Missing Positive Number** – located the kth missing number using binary search logic  
3. **Min Days to Make M Bouquets** – applied binary search on answers to minimize days required for bouquets  

---

###  Reflection  
- Strengthened my grasp on **binary search in mathematical problems**  
- Learned that many optimization problems can be reframed as **binary search on feasible answers**  
- These problems sharpened intuition for applying search in **non-direct array scenarios**
