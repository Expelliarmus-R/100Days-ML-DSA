# Day 6 – Data Structures & Algorithms  

### What I Learned Today  
- Continued practicing **Binary Search on answers** problems  
- Solved a mix of **search-based** and **constraint-based optimization** problems  
- Learned how to apply binary search when dealing with conditions instead of direct values  

---

### Problems Covered  
1. **First and Last Occurrence** – find first and last position of an element in a sorted array  
2. **Kth Missing Positive Number** – locate the kth missing number using binary search logic  
3. **Min Days to Make M Bouquets** – applied binary search on answers to minimize days under constraints  

---

### Reflection  
- Reinforced the idea that **binary search is highly versatile** across problem types  
- First/Last occurrence strengthened handling of **edge cases** in sorted arrays  
- Bouquet problem improved understanding of **feasibility checks** in optimization problems
